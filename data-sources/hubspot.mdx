HubSpot is an integrated marketing, sales, and customer service platform that provides businesses with tools to attract, engage, and delight customers throughout their lifecycle.

It can also act as a relational database. To learn more about HubSpot and its features, visit the [official HubSpot website](https://www.hubspot.com/).

In this article, we will cover how to connect HubSpot and then take a closer look at some of the features that are important to consider in that context.

<Info>

**HubSpot** integration is available on **Business** and **Enterprise** plans.

## 1. Connect your HubSpot account

To use HubSpot in Softr, you must first **connect your HubSpot account**. Any HubSpot data source you connect in Softr can be used by all of the workspace's collaborators in all of the workspace’s apps.

<Warning>

To connect HubSpot, you must have HubSpot Super Admin access.

</Warning>

<Steps>

    2. Click **Connect Data Source.**

    3. Select **HubSpot** and proceed to authenticate your account.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Connect your HubSpot data to a Softr app

Once your HubSpot account is connected, you can use the authorized account across one or multiple Softr applications.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect the HubSpot objects to a Dynamic Block">
    To display your data in the app, connect a [dynamic block](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/visualize-data-with-building-blocks/41p6U2eZs7zgY8zWmFV4eH#1859a723d691803d9551ecd7b3b0c043) (e.g. [List](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU), [Grid](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/grid-block/42JZoeYwMsogZcveqh74QH), [Table](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/table-block-/j7rGwu7J7zuU69h3bZ7HFe)) to your HubSpot objects:

    1. In the Block **source tab**, select the authenticated HubSpot integration.

    2. Choose the **Object** you want to use.

    <Warning>

    **Important:** You can connect only one object type to one block. For example, if you want to show a list of clients, you can select the **Companies** object. If you would like to show **Tickets**, you will need to add another **dynamic block**.
    </Warning>

    ### Supported HubSpot Objects

    Softr supports the following **HubSpot objects**:

    * **Contacts**

    * **Companies**

    * **Deals**

    * **Tickets**

    * **Notes**

    * **Tasks**

    * **Custom Objects**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mapping HubSpot object fields">
    When you select the object type you want to show, you can customize which object properties you want to visualize alongside. Each HubSpot object has **predefined field types** like text, dropdowns, and date pickers. Since Softr also has its field types, it's important to **map fields correctly** to ensure your data appears as expected.

    For example, if a HubSpot **deal property** contains an image stored as a **File type**, you should map it to a **Softr Image field** in a **List block** so it displays correctly.
    <Frame caption="Mapping HubSpot object properties.">![Mapping HubSpot object properties.](/data-sources/images/hubspot/image4.png)</Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported Properties

Softr supports:

* All default HubSpot object properties

* All custom properties you’ve created in HubSpot

However, some **read-only fields** cannot be edited in Softr, including:

* Computed fields like **Calculation** fields, **Rollup**, **Count**, and **Formula** fields.

### HubSpot object associations

HubSpot works as a **relational database**, meaning objects can be linked together through **associations**. This allows you to display related data, such as:

* A **Deal** with multiple **Tasks** linked to it

* A **Company** associated with multiple **Contacts**

In Softr, you can show associated objects using:

1. [Linked List Block](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/linked-list/bWjTdKhbftofSEKRSxMFz9)

2. Associated Object IDs property

**Limitations**

<Warning>

Associated objects cannot currently be used in [Visibility Conditional Filters](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/block-visibility/3spA2dfQNrcGcPNmnDXHB3).

</Warning>
<Info>

Currently, the **Charts, Inbox, Map, Org Chart,** blocks are not supported. These will be available in future updates.

</Info>

## FAQs
   <AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title="Why can't I see certain HubSpot fields in Softr?">
Some HubSpot fields and objects require **Sensitive Data scopes** for API access. You may need to enable these permissions in HubSpot if certain data is missing or restricted. [Learn how to enable Sensitive Data Scopes in HubSpot](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/properties/store-sensitive-data).
   </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Can I use multiple HubSpot accounts in one Softr app?">
Yes! You can connect multiple HubSpot accounts but need to use **separate Softr blocks** for each object.
