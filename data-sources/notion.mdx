**Notion** is more than just a note-taking tool—it combines project management and databases, making it a stronger alternative to spreadsheets for organizing and collaborating on data in one place.

By using [Notion databases](https://www.notion.so/help/what-is-a-database) with Softr, you can easily create Client Portals, Internal Tools, and other business apps to:

* Offer a simple, user-friendly experience

* Control access to specific data

* Secure logins without Notion invites

* Let users submit, edit, and sync data seamlessly

* Collect forms, feedback, and inputs effortlessly

## **1. Connect your Notion account**

To use Notion in Softr, you must first **link your Notion account**. Here’s how:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Notion data source to your workspace">
    To create an app using a Notion database, the first step is to add Notion as a data source in Softr. You can do this either through the **Data Sources** section of the Softr dashboard or by adding a new data source directly to a block within your application.
    <Frame>![Image](/data-sources/images/notion/image1.png)</Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant access to the Notion databases you want to use in your workspace.">
    After selecting Notion as the data source, you’ll be redirected to the **Notion Authorization** page. On this page, select the workspace and top-level pages containing the databases you wish to connect to Softr.
    <Frame>![Notion image](/data-sources/images/notion/image2.png)</Frame>
    <Info>

    You can authorize the integration only for Notion workspaces where you are **a member.**
    </Info>
    <Frame>![Notion image](/data-sources/images/notion/image3.png)</Frame>
    <Info>

    Once connected, **only Notion database pages** can be used with Softr dynamic blocks, such as List and Detail blocks.

    </Info>

    To finalize the connection, click the "Allow Access" button to grant Softr permission to access your Notion account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **2. Connect your Notion database to your Softr app**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your data to a dynamic block">
    To display your data in the app, connect a [dynamic block](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/visualize-data-with-building-blocks/41p6U2eZs7zgY8zWmFV4eH#1859a723d691803d9551ecd7b3b0c043) (e.g. [List](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU), [Grid](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/grid-block/42JZoeYwMsogZcveqh74QH), [Table](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/table-block-/j7rGwu7J7zuU69h3bZ7HFe)) to your Notion database:

    1. Go to the Block **source** **tab** and select your Notion integration.

    2. Pick the **database** you want to use.

    Once you select the Notion account, the pages within that database will display as individual records in your application.
    <Frame>![Notion image](/data-sources/images/notion/image4.png)</Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Notion columns to item fields">
    Once your data source is connected to a block, you can map individual fields to display the desired information.
    <Frame>![Notion image](/data-sources/images/notion/image5.png)</Frame>

    In Notion, properties are essentially the columns in the database, with each property having a predefined type, such as **Files**, **Status**, **Date**, and more. Similarly, Softr offers a variety of field types to choose from when displaying your data. It's important to select the appropriate field type when mapping fields from Notion to Softr.

    For example, in the image below, we’ve mapped a **File** property from Notion to an **Image** field type on Softr’s List block to display photos.
    <Frame>![Image](/data-sources/images/notion/image6.png)</Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Supported fields**

Most fields that can be edited in Notion are also editable in Softr. However, there are exceptions. Fields that are automatically generated by Notion, such as **Rollup, Formula** and **People** can be displayed but not edited within Softr.

<Info>

The following read-only fields are not supported: **Last edited by, Last edited time, Created time, Created by, ID, Button.**

Why Dates Look Different in Notion and Softr

If dates from Notion show differently in Softr (e.g., "14-05-2025" instead of "15-05-2025"), it’s due to time zone handling in Notion formulas. Here’s why and how to fix it.

What’s Happening?

A Notion formula like format calmaDate(Data, "DD-MM-YYYY") pulls from a date field, e.g., "2025-05-14T22:00:00.000+00:00" (May 14, 2025, 10:00 PM UTC).

* Notion: Shows the date in your local time zone (e.g., Italian, UTC+2), where 10:00 PM UTC is midnight May 15, so it displays "15-05-2025".

* Softr: Uses UTC from Notion’s data, showing "14-05-2025" for May 14.

This mismatch occurs because the date includes a time (10:00 PM UTC), which shifts the day depending on the time zone.

Why Now?

Your Notion date field may have recently changed to use 10:00 PM UTC instead of midnight UTC, causing the day to shift in different time zones.

How to Fix It

1. Use Midnight UTCSet Notion dates to midnight UTC (e.g., "2025-05-14T00:00:00.000+00:00").How: In Notion, set dates to 12:00 AM UTC or exclude time.

2. Skip Time AltogetherUse only dates (no times) in Notion for consistent display.How: Set the date field to “Date Only” in Notion.

Best Option?

If times aren’t needed, choose Skip Time Altogether for simplicity. Otherwise, use Midnight UTC.

### Database relations

The [Relation](https://www.notion.so/help/relations-and-rollups) property in Notion is essential for creating a **relational database**. It allows you to link records from one database to another, enabling the seamless display of related information across your boards.

For example, if you have two Notion databases—**Clients** and **Projects**—you can add a Relation property to **Clients** to link it with **Projects**. This lets you easily display all projects associated with a specific client.
<Frame>![Notion image](/data-sources/images/notion/image7.png)</Frame>
<Info>

Due to limitations in the Notion API, Relation fields cannot be displayed in List-type dynamic blocks (List, Table, Inbox, etc). As an alternative, we recommend creating a **Rollup field** based on the Relation field and using that for display.

</Info>

### Conditional filters based on relation

[Conditional filters](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/conditional-filters/mDnn7jnpPiYmJcT99jpt7m) allow you to display specific records based on set conditions. This feature is handy when showing related records between databases. For example, if you have a "Client Detail" page, you can display a list of projects related to a specific client.
<Frame caption="Conditional filters with related record set up">![Conditional filters with related record set up](/data-sources/images/notion/image8.png)</Frame><Frame caption="Published application with conditional filter set up">![Published application with conditional filter set up](/data-sources/images/notion/image9.png)</Frame>

### How to show sub-items

If your database includes sub-items, here’s how you can choose what shows up in your Softr blocks.

**Show both items and sub-items**

When you connect your database to a dynamic block, you’ll automatically see both items and sub-items.
<Frame>![Notion image](/data-sources/images/notion/image10.png)</Frame>
<Info>

Note: The block will display them as one flat list—it won't keep the parent- child hierarchy.

</Info>

**Show only top-level items**

To hide sub-items and show only top-level items, add a Conditional filter: `Parent item is empty`
<Frame>![Notion image](/data-sources/images/notion/image11.png)</Frame>

**Show only sub-items**

To show just sub-items (and hide the top-level items), add a Conditional filter: `Parent item - is not empty`.
<Frame>![Notion image](/data-sources/images/notion/image12.png)</Frame>

**Show items with sub-items in a detail page**

Want users to click an item and see its sub-items on a new page? Here's how:

1. Filter the list to show only top-level items (`Parent item - is empty`).

2. In **Actions**, set **Action on click** → **Open detail page** (or create a one).

3. In the detail page, add a list block.

4. Set that block to show sub-items related to the current item:<br/>

   `Parent item - Includes any of → Current record {Primary column name}`

## FAQ
   <AccordionGroup>
   <Accordion title="My Notion is connected to Softr, but I don’t see the page or database I’m trying to access.">
This can happen when you add a page or database to Notion after you have already created the connection to Softr. To fix this, navigate to the page you want to give Softr access to and click on the ellipses icon in the upper right corner. Hover over the Connections, search for Softr and select it.
<Frame>![Notion image](/data-sources/images/notion/image14.png)</Frame>

Notion will ask you to confirm letting Softr access this page. Note that you will need to refresh Softr editor to see the newly connected page or database.
<Frame>![Notion image](/data-sources/images/notion/image15.png)</Frame>
   </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Can I use multiple Notion workspaces in one Softr app?">
Yes! You can connect multiple Notion workspaces but need to use **separate Softr blocks** for each database.
   </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Why do dates look different in Notion and Softr?">
