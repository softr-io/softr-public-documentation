## **1. Connect your SmartSuite account**

To use SmartSuite in Softr, you must first **connect your SmartSuite account**. Any SmartSuite data source you add to Softr can be used across all apps within your Softr workspace.

<Steps>

    2. Click **Connect data source**.

    3. Select **SmartSuite** from the list.

    4. Log in to your **SmartSuite** account (if not already).

    5. Authorize Softr to access your SmartSuite data.

</Steps>

## **2. Connect your SmartSuite data to your Softr app**

After connecting SmartSuite, you can use its data in any Softr app.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your data to a dynamic block">
    To display your data in the app, connect a [dynamic block](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/visualize-data-with-building-blocks/41p6U2eZs7zgY8zWmFV4eH#1859a723d691803d9551ecd7b3b0c043) (e.g., [List](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU), [Grid](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/grid-block/42JZoeYwMsogZcveqh74QH), [Table](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/table-block-/j7rGwu7J7zuU69h3bZ7HFe)) to your SmartSuite table:

    1. Go to the Block **source** **tab** and select your SmartSuite integration.

    2. Select the **workspace** and **solution** you want to connect.

    3. Pick the **table** you want to use.

    <Warning>

    **Important**: Each **block can connect to only one SmartSuite table**. If you need to display data from multiple tables, use separate blocks.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Map SmartSuite fields to item fields in softr">
    Each SmartSuite table has multiple fields (columns) with predefined types (e.g., File, Yes/No, Formula). Connecting your table to a block lets you choose which SmartSuite **fields** to display and map it to a Softr field. This lets you control how your Smartusuite data appears in Softr.

    **Example:** If your SmartSuite table has a **Photos (Files & Images field)**, map it to an **Image field** in Softr to display it correctly.

### **Supported Fields**

Most editable SmartSuite fields can be modified in Softr, but some computed fields are **read-only**, including:

* **Formula fields**

* **Rollup fields**

* **Lookup fields**

### **Linked Records**

One of SmartSuite’s key features is **Linked Records**, which allows you to create relationships between tables. This makes SmartSuite a **relational database**.

For example, if you have two SmartSuite tables:

* **Tasks**

* **Projects**

You can link the **Tasks table** to the **Projects table** to show which project each task belongs to.

Below, you can see the **Tasks table**, where the **Project field** is a linked record showing data from the **Projects table**.

**Limitations**

<Info>

Currently, the **Charts, Inbox, Map, Org Chart,** blocks are not supported. These will be available in future updates.
