Google Sheets is a cloud-based spreadsheet solution used by millions worldwide. While it may not be as powerful as Airtable in terms of data management, it is a popular and free tool that many users already rely on. In this guide, we'll walk you through **connecting Google Sheets as a data source** for your Softr app and discuss some of its **advantages and limitations**.

## **1. Connecting your Google Sheets account**

To start using Google Sheets in Softr, you must first connect your account.

* Open [Softr’s Data Sources](https://studio.softr.io/dashboard/data-sources) settings.

* Click the **Connect data source.**

* Select **Google Sheets** and log in to your account.

* Check all required permission boxes.

## **2. Connect your Google Sheet data to your Softr app**

Once your Google Sheets account is connected, you can use it in any Softr application.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your data to a dynamic block">
    To display your data in the app, connect a **dynamic block** to your Google Sheet.

    1. Go to the Block **Source** **tab** and select your GSheet integration.

    2. Select the **document** you want to connect.

    3. Pick the **sheet** you want to use.<br/>

  <Step title="Step 2. Mapping Google Sheets columns to Softr field">
    <Tip>

    When mapping Sheets data to Softr, it’s best to have at least 1 row of sample data in each table/sheet so that Softr can properly determine the field types.

    </Tip>

    Google Sheets stores data in a table format, where each **column represents a field**, and each **row is a record**. To ensure smooth integration, structure your sheet with:

    * **The first row as field names** (e.g., "Assignee," "Status," "Description").

    * **Data stored in rows** under the appropriate column headers.

    When you connect your board to a block, you can choose which Sheet **columns** to display and map it to a Softr field. This lets you control how your GSheet data appears in Softr.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Record ID Column**

Once you connect a sheet to Softr, a **Softr Record ID** column is automatically added. This unique ID helps Softr reference records (e.g., linking a List block to a List Details block).

<Warning>

**Ensure you have edit permissions** for your Google Sheet so Softr can add and update this column. Do not delete it.
</Warning>

<Tip>

**Tip**: Use **Softr Record IDs** to link related records across sheets (e.g., setting a "Manager ID" as another user's Softr ID).

</Tip>
