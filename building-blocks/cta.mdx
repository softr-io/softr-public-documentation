# Common Block Features

## Title, Subtitle, and Background Image

These settings are located under the **Features** tab of block settings, and here you customize the **Title** and **Subtitle** texts and can add a **Background Image** for the whole block.

## Button

By default, there's only one button, but you can use the **Add Button** option to add more buttons.

In the [Call to action with email capture](/6772b65a34c84bfdbe1bc16e8b03f525) layout the button allows to capture the user's email, but in the rest of the layouts it has the following **Action** options:

* **Open page** to open another page within the app;

* **Scroll to section** to scroll to a specific section within the page;

* **Open external url;**

* **Open Modal** to open another page within a pop-up.
