## Overview

A 401 page is an error message shown by a web server when a user tries to access a resource without proper authentication. It indicates that the request lacks valid credentials, such as a username or password, and prompts the user to log in or provide authorization.

In Softr we call this page Permission Denied, but you can change this to whatever you like - the functionality will stay the same. The page cannot be deleted or removed except by disabling Login functionality in your app’s [User Authentication](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-authentication/7gJmq6B7syYE3hRoFxLs5J) settings.

To access the Permission Denied page/block:

1. Ensure Login is enabled in the [User Authentication](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-authentication/7gJmq6B7syYE3hRoFxLs5J) settings.

2. Click on the Pages menu

3. Select the Permission Denied page from the Utility pages section

4. Click anywhere on the block itself to open additional settings.
