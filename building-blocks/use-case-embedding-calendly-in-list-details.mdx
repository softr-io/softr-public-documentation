First of all, you need to get your Calendly embed code, as described [here](/custom-code/3idxDhKqz1qPdqBuWbs61G/custom-code-block-overview/6XNrxFopUEiwbWipq81Eq1). Further on, create a corresponding field in your [data source](/4230abecf813402aa2926466c313290a) that you're using for the List Details block. In the example shown below, we've created a **Single line text** field named "Calendly" in [Airtable](/data-sources/1YYStCJukT15Lh2j93qo9A/airtable/jHX7kfH7QvkVcELQvS3VoX) and added the embed code to one of the rows.

Next, we’re going to add an **Embed** type field to the List Details block and link the "Calendly" field from Airtable.

That's it. Now the Calendly embed will start appearing on the list item as shown below.

# Other Integrations

You can embed other publicly accessible integrations this way as well. Some ones we’ve seen aside from Calendly are Trello cards, Google Docs, YouTube videos, and Github issues.
