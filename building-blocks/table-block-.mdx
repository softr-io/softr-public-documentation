The **Table block** presents a collection of records, such as tasks, products, or contacts, in a structured table layout. This format is particularly effective for displaying data with multiple fields, allowing users to efficiently compare, sort, and manage large sets of information efficiently. Each record is organized into rows, while columns represent fields like name, date, tag, or status. Tables are interactive, supporting the sorting and filtering of data.

## **Use case examples**

* **Client Profiles:** Display detailed customer information, including name, company, contact details, last interaction date, and associated account manager. Enable filtering by account status (active, inactive, etc.).

* **Invoice Management:** Provide clients with a table of invoices showing invoice numbers, issue dates, due dates, amounts, and payment statuses. Clients can sort by due date or filter unpaid invoices.

# Configure a Table block

## Source

The **Source** panel connects the list block to your data source. Here, you can:

* Connect the list block to your[data source](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/connect-your-data-source/41p6U2eZs6NZ5qZp7iKvnn).

* Set up[conditional filters](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/conditional-filters/mDnn7jnpPiYmJcT99jpt7m) to display only the data that meets specific criteria.

* **Define sorting rules** and set the number of items to display per page.

* **Customize the empty state message** that appears when no data matches the requirements.

Once you connect to your source data, you can configure Content, Actions, and block Visibility settings.

<Info>

Some configuration options depend on the [data source](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/connect-your-data-source/41p6U2eZs6NZ5qZp7iKvnn). For more details, check the documentation for your specific data source.

## **Content**

In the **Content** tab, customize fields in your table block, adjust their display, and add features like search and filters to help users find information quickly.

### **Item fields**

**Item Fields** lets you connect fields from your **data source** to each list item, making it easy to display the information you need. You can control what information appears by adding, removing, or rearranging fields such as task names, assignees, or descriptions.

For each field in the **Item Fields** section of the secondary section, you can customize the following options:

* **Type:** Defines the display field type that controls how content appears in the block (e.g., text, checkbox, or image).

* **Content:** Chooses the specific data field from connected data sources to display.

* **Label (Optional):** Adds context to the field. If left blank, the label will not be visible to users.

<Info>

**Note:** Some display field types are compatible only with specific data formats. For example, if a field is set to display images, you cannot map it to text data. Ensure the field type matches your data source field format to avoid display issues.

2. In the individual field settings, toggle the **Allow editing** option to enable editing.

    1. **Configure** how users interact with editable cells:
        * Input Field Type – Choose the input type users will see (e.g., short text, long text) and configure any additional options based on the selected type.
        * Placeholder – Provide guidance for empty fields; this placeholder appears when users click to edit a cell.

### **Search bar**

The **Search Bar** allows users to search through items in your block, making it easier to find specific entries quickly.

You can configure which parameters you want the search to be performed by adding fields to Search by input. For instance, if you’re displaying a list of employees, you might select “Name,” “Department,” and “Job title” as searchable fields.
<Frame>![Notion image](/building-blocks/images/grid-block/image4.png)</Frame>
<Info>

If no fields are selected, the search bar will display all items regardless of the search term. To ensure meaningful search results, always select at least one field.
