The Comments block lets users add and view comments linked to a specific item in your app — like a project, task, or client. It’s perfect for sharing updates, asking questions, or keeping track of important details in one place.

### Key things to know

* Comments can be enabled from any [Item detail block](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/item-details-block-/4bE8XaFbJp45wkAwuWiz8f)or any list type block ([List](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU), [Grid](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/grid-block/42JZoeYwMsogZcveqh74QH), [Table](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/table-block-/j7rGwu7J7zuU69h3bZ7HFe))

* **Comments are always linked to a record** — they can’t exist on their own.

* You **don’t need to set up an extra table** to store them. Comments are saved directly inside your Softr app.

* Each record has **one comment thread**, even if you show it in multiple places.

* You can show comments as:
  + A **block** on a details page
  + A **side panel** (new!) that opens when clicking a button on a list

### Examples

Here’s how you can use comments in your app:

* **Projects** – Let your team discuss project updates or next steps.

* **Support tickets** – Add internal notes or track follow-ups.

* **Clients** – Keep a record of conversations or important context.

### Comments settings and customization

Go to **Settings → Comments** to control how comments work across your app. From there, you can:

* Add features like **Rich text formatting** and **file upload** option.

* Change the **sorting order**, visual **style**, and **message text**

* Set **who can comment or view comments** (e.g. everyone, only Admins)

### Notifications

Your app users can toggle Notifications on and off on the comments if they want to be notified by email when a new comment occurs on an item. You can also customize the notification emails that are sent to your users in the Notification section of the Comment Settings menu.
