## When to use Quick Links

Our Quick Links block looks like a dynamic list block, but it’s actually a super convenient way to show a polished grid of tiles to act as links to other pages in your app or even external URLs. Here’s when it might make sense to use the Quick Links block:

* Showing a list of most commonly accessed forms in your Softr app

* Providing users quick access to a list of external tools or sites.

* Displaying a customized list of links to other pages based on [User Group](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/user-groups/6XQfKMeKHUvBcAjKvLs3g3).

* Showcasing a list of static features, icons, or images - maybe you don’t need to link to anything!

## Adding a Quick Links Block

To add a Quick Links block:

1. In Softr Studio, open your app and navigate to the page in your Softr app that you want to add the block to.

2. Hover over and click on the plus icon on the page.

3. Select the **Static** tab to open the list of Static blocks.

4. Open the **Quick Links** dropdown and select the Quick Links block to add it.

## Features and Settings

### Content

* **Layout**: Choose between horizontally oriented cards or vertically oriented cards. Here you can also control the card width, the card’s content alignment, whether to use icons or images, the label/icon position, whether to show or hide the arrow guidance icons, and other options.

* **Embed**: Once you have published your application, you can get an embed code to embed just the Quick Links block in another website or application. Note that if the block is behind a user group or login, it may not be visible. If you plan to Embed the block, make sure it’s publicly accessible.

### Styles

In this tab, you can edit the overall styling of the Quick Links such as rounding, card colors, title and subtitle fonts/colors, and more. Note that much of the styling is inherited from the [app theme](/styling/7qXYEkNvWQamR6vcLXzZnF/application-theme/91YGSL2aDJajXdbPBhitbc) itself.
