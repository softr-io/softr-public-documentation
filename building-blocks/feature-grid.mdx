The Feature Grid block displays a collection of items in a grid layout. As the name suggests, it is meant to be used for listing product features, however, it can be also used for displaying any sort of lists (in some cases, the [List block](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU) may be more relevant depending on your use case). Let’s explore the block setting to see how it’s configured.

## Header

In the **Header** section of block settings, you can customize the **Title** and **Subtitle** as well as add a background image for the whole block.

## Features

In the Features section, you can customize each feature’s icon/image, title, description, as well as the link. Also, you can add new features, delete existing ones, as well as reorganize those.
