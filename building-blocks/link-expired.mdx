## Overview

When you use Magic Links for user authentication or send invitation links for users to join your app, they will be using a unique link. Invite links expire after not being accepted within a certain timeframe. With Magic Links, although they never expire, they can be re-generated or deleted altogether in the Users menu. In either of the cases where the links are no longer valid, users will be sent to the Link Expired page in your app.

You can name this page whatever you like, but the functionality will remain the same. The Link Expired page will only appear if Login is enabled in the [User Authentication](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-authentication/7gJmq6B7syYE3hRoFxLs5J) settings.

To access the Link Expired page/block:

1. Ensure Login is enabled in the [User Authentication](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-authentication/7gJmq6B7syYE3hRoFxLs5J) settings.

2. Click on the Pages menu

3. Select the Link Expired page from the Utility pages section

4. Click anywhere on the block itself to open additional settings.
