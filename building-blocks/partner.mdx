Using the **Partner** block you can present your partners, key customers, and so on. The block consists of a **Title**, **Subtitle**, and a list of partner logos. Let's see how each of those is configured.

## Title and Subtitle
<Frame caption="Title and Subtitle">![Title and Subtitle](/building-blocks/images/partner/image2.png)</Frame>

Here you enter the **Title** and **Subtitle** texts.

## Partners

In this section you add the partners along with their **Image** and **Link.**

Each partner item is added within a separate tab. You can add new tabs, delete, and reorganize them. Additional rows will be added depending on the number of partner items. Check out the gif below to get a better idea.

## Layout: **Partner with sliding logos**
