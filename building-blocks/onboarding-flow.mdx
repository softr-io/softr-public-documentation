Softr’s **Onboarding Flow pages** let you deliver a polished, customized onboarding experience the first time a user logs in—whether they’re signing up or being invited to your app.

Use it to prompt users to complete their profile, create a new record (e.g. a company connected to that user), or simply guide them through the app—all without custom code or workarounds.

## ✨ What you can do with onboarding flows

* **Welcome new users with a tailored experience**<br/>

    Capture key profile info, add a linked record, or display a welcome message or walkthrough.

* **Show different flows to different users**<br/>

    Assign onboarding flows based on **signup page** or **user group**—so team members, clients, or partners get the right experience.

* **Track onboarding progress at a glance**<br/>

    See onboarding status directly in the **Users** tab, and manually mark as completed or reset if needed.

## 🔧 How to set it up

### 1. Add an onboarding flow page

* Go to **Pages** in the left-side menu

* Under **Utility Pages**, click **Onboarding Flow**

You can create as many onboarding flows as needed—each one will be treated as its own dedicated utility page. Every app must have at least one onboarding flow.

### 2. Choose your flow type and data setup

* In the **Settings** tab of the onboarding page, choose your **Flow type**:
  + **Complete user profile** – collect additional profile fields related to the user (e.g. role, preferences). Note that this will only be possible if you have your [Users synced with a data source](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/syncing-users-with-a-data-source/hshRGygHr4T33EnaLntGf9).
  + **Add new record** – capture a linked record like a form response or onboarding survey
  + **Display information only** – show static content like welcome instructions or next steps

* Link to the relevant **data source** and **table** (if applicable)

### 3. Set the steps

* Navigate to the **Steps** tab

* Define the content or inputs users will go through. This is the same form builder as conditional forms, but it’s specifically used to build the steps they should go through in the flow.

* Choose what happens when onboarding is complete (e.g. redirect to dashboard, thank-you page, or other app page)

### 4. Assign who sees each onboarding flow

* Go to either the **Assign** button the Setting tab or go to **Pages > Page Rules**

* Assign your onboarding flow to specific users based on either:
  + **Signup Page, or**
  + **User Group**

<Tip>

The onboarding flow will only appear during a user’s **first login session** based on these rules.

### 5. Create additional flows

* Need different onboarding flows for different users?<br/>

  Just **duplicate your existing Onboarding Flow utility page**, update the content, and apply new rules.

---

### 6. Track and manage onboarding status

* Go to the **Users** tab > User table

* Scroll to the **Onboarding** column to see each user’s onboarding status

* You can also manually:
  + **Reset onboarding** for a user
  + **Mark onboarding as completed** if needed

## ✅ Things to keep in mind

* Onboarding flows are **only shown once**, on the user’s first signup/login

* You can set up **multiple flows per app** and control visibility with [Page Rules](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/page-rules/6zZKpehWhQhCGH9XXAFrpT).

* All onboarding flows live under [**Utility Pages**](https://docs.softr.io/application-settings/n3K2UEfpC9BpHgakMzUU5Y/utility-pages/49UoDpTpTPbkoKVwksoqfh), and can be managed like any other Utility page
