# Configure a Calendar block

## Source

The **Source** panel connects the list block to your data source. Here, you can:

* Connect the list block to your[data source](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/connect-your-data-source/41p6U2eZs6NZ5qZp7iKvnn).

* Set up[conditional filters](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/conditional-filters/mDnn7jnpPiYmJcT99jpt7m) to display only the data that meets specific criteria.

* **Define sorting rules** and set the number of items to display per page.

* **Customize the empty state message** that appears when no data matches the requirements.

Once you connect to your source data, you can configure Content, Actions, and block Visibility settings.

<Info>

Some configuration options depend on the [data source](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/connect-your-data-source/41p6U2eZs6NZ5qZp7iKvnn). For more details, check the documentation for your specific data source.

## **Content**

In the **Content** tab, customize the Calendar layout data fields, adjust their display, and add features like search and filters to help users find information quickly.

### **Event fields**

The **Calendar block** uses default event fields to display your events. Make sure to map the following required fields:

* **Event Title:** Displays the name of the event on the calendar.

* **Start Time:** Specifies when the event begins, shown on the calendar.

* **End Time:** Specifies when the event ends, shown on the calendar.

<Info>

If you’re using [GSheet](/data-sources/1YYStCJukT15Lh2j93qo9A/google-sheets/jznC9Jr3Jri224AVmHVn4a) as your data source you can specify if the date field includes time and define the time format you would like it to be displayed.

</Info>

### Calendar Views

Customize how users interact with the calendar by enabling multiple view options. Available views include:

* **Month View:** Ideal for an overview of all events within a month.

* **Week View:** Focuses on events for a single week, with detailed time slots.

* **Day View:** Displays events for a single day, perfect for detailed scheduling.

* **Agenda View:** Lists events in chronological order for a streamlined overview.

You can decide which views are available for your users and set a **default view** they will see when they open the calendar.

### **Event Popover**

The **Event Popover** appears when a user clicks on an event. By default, it includes:

* Event Title

* Event start and end date

You can customize the popover to include additional fields from your data source, such as location, description, or tags, providing more context for each event.
<Frame>![Notion image](/building-blocks/images/calendar/image5.png)</Frame>

### **Item fields**

**Item Fields** lets you connect fields from your **data source** to each list item, making it easy to display the information you need. You can control what information appears by adding, removing, or rearranging fields such as task names, assignees, or descriptions.

For each field in the **Item Fields** section of the secondary section, you can customize the following options:

* **Type:** Defines the display field type that controls how content appears in the block (e.g., text, checkbox, or image).

* **Content:** Chooses the specific data field from connected data sources to display.

* **Label (Optional):** Adds context to the field. If left blank, the label will not be visible to users.
  <Frame>![Notion image](/building-blocks/images/grid-block/image3.png)</Frame>

<Info>

**Note:** Some display field types are compatible only with specific data formats. For example, if a field is set to display images, you cannot map it to text data. Ensure the field type matches your data source field format to avoid display issues.
