Footers allow your app users to access links and pages at the bottom of your app pages. Sometimes you may have more links and screens to show them than can fit on the main navigation. Footers are a great way to provide complementary and enriches information about your app that are not as commonly needed, such as Terms of Service, Privacy Policy links, Careers pages, social links, etc.

<Info>

Any Footers you create can be enabled or disabled on any page in your app. For instance, you may want a footer on your landing page, but not on the dashboard page once your users are logged in.

    The footer provides a host of options so you can build exactly what you need. Once a footer has been turned on for a page, click anywhere in the Footer to open its settings panel. Let’s take a look at some of the options available.

    **Rename**

    You can rename the footer in the Content tab. This will also be reflected in the page settings options when selecting footers.

    **Layout**

    In the Layout section, you can choose the general format of your footer such as Columns or Simple. You can further refine this layout in other settings below. Also in this section is a toggle for centering the secondary Link section if using Columns, or centering all the content if using the Simple layout.

    **Styles**

    Click on the Styles tab to adjust the colors to be used in the footer. These are derived from the [Theme](/styling/7qXYEkNvWQamR6vcLXzZnF/application-theme/91YGSL2aDJajXdbPBhitbc) panel of your app.

    Adjusting the sizing affects font size, logo size, margins, and other aspects of the footer.

    If you need more customization you can always use [custom code](/custom-code/3idxDhKqz1qPdqBuWbs61G) as well.

## Adjusting the visibility of footer links

You can adjust which links and link categories are visible to different users based on their [User Group](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/user-groups/6XQfKMeKHUvBcAjKvLs3g3). To do this, click on the Content tab, hover over a footer link or link category and select the branching icon.

Here you can adjust which users the link or category is visible to as well as which devices the link should be shown on. For example, Logged-in users may not need to see a link to Sign up or login since they are already logged in.
