## Adding a new block version

If a new version of a particular block has been released, you'll see an **Block Update Available** notification at the bottom of your block settings sidebar (as shown below). Using this functionality, you can update your block to its latest version with a single click, preserving all the stylings and configurations.

Click **View details** to see the update changelog and make the update.

<Tip>Note that there might be cases (of which you'll be notified in block settings) when the **Update Block** option won't be available and you'll need to remove the block and add it again, redoing the block setup.</Tip>

## Deprecated block versions

Occasionally, we release updated versions of specific blocks and mark older ones as deprecated. A deprecated block will still work in your published app, but its settings can’t be changed.

If you see a deprecated message in the block’s settings, we recommend adding the latest version to benefit from new features, improvements, and ongoing support.
