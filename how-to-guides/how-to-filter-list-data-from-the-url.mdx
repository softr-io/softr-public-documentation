This is a handy feature if you want your users to be taken to a filtered version of your List via URL. You can filter the list through an **Inline Filter** or **Search**. Let’s consider the Inline Filter case first.

## Filtering the list through an inline filter

To filter the list by one of the Inline Filter values, you need to use the following format: **?filter-by-fieldName=fieldValue**

<Tip>In order for the URL filter to work, you need to have an [Inline Filter](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU) set up for the same field in your list.</Tip>

You should add the filtering parameters at the end of your List URL, replacing **fieldName** with the name of the field you want to use for filtering and **fieldValue** with the value you want to filter by. Let's consider a specific example to make it clear.

### **Example**

Let's say we have a list of employee profiles with a **Position** field and want to have a URL that filters the list, leaving only the profiles where the **Position** is **Engineer**.
<Frame caption="List of employee profiles">![List of employee profiles](/how-to-guides/images/how-to-filter-list-data-from-the-url/image1.png)</Frame>

First of all, let's set up a corresponding Inline Filter.
<Frame caption="Adding an inline filter">![Adding an inline filter](/how-to-guides/images/how-to-filter-list-data-from-the-url/image2.png)</Frame>

Next, let's configure the URL, which will look as follows:

* https://\{subdomain}.softr.app/list?filter-by-Position=Engineer

<Tip>Note that both **fieldName** and **fieldValue** are case sensitive. For instance, in the current example, the field name should be **"Position"** and not **"position"** or **"POSITION."**</Tip>

That's it. Now, let's check if everything is working correctly.

Testing the filtering

<Tip>If you have a space inside your field name or value, you can replace it with **"%20"**
inside the URL.</Tip>

## Filtering the list through search

To pre-filter the list through search, you need to use the following format: **?search-for=searchValue**

<Tip>In order for the URL parameter to work, you need to have a search bar set up for your list with **Search by** field(s) selected.</Tip>

You should add the parameter at the end of your List URL, replacing **searchValue** with the query you want to filter the list by. Let's consider a specific example to make it clear.

### Example

Let’s say we have a list of tasks for a software development team, where each task has a name.
<Frame caption="A list of tasks">![A list of tasks](/how-to-guides/images/how-to-filter-list-data-from-the-url/image4.png)</Frame>

So, if we add the following parameter at the end of our page URL, we will see a list that only contains entries with a value “merge”: **?search-for=merge**

## Combining search and inline filters

It’s also possible to combine inline filter and search parameter formats by simply joining them with an “&”: **?filter-by-fieldName=fieldValue&search-for=searchValue**

As a result, only the list records that match **both of the conditions** will be displayed.
