You can use this specific variable `{LOGGED_IN_USER:NAME}` in any static text field to show the logged-in user name. This feature works with any static fields on blocks such as title, subtitle, a placeholder for input fields, button text, etc.

You can do this with any field or column in the Users table of your datasource. Try to remove special characters and spaces from field names that you want to display in this way. The variable is also case-sensitive.

## Example

Add a welcome hero block with Title: *👋 Welcome to your portal,* `{LOGGED_IN_USER:NAME}`
