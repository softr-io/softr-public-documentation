We've already discussed how you can [build a blog using static Softr blocks](/how-to-guides/ioi5BbuQ2RDM7aHPrpXnjG/how-to-create-a-blog/5Vhtsqxp1VFpURgjGbdVVc). However, it's also possible to create a block, storing all your content and media in one of our [data sources](/4230abecf813402aa2926466c313290a). To do that, you can use one of our [List](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU) layouts to display data from a data source. Further on, the List block can be connected to a [List Details](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/item-details-block-/4bE8XaFbJp45wkAwuWiz8f) block, so that your readers can click on the list item to open the blog post on a separate page.

Additionally, it's also possible to [configure the List Details data](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/item-details-block-/4bE8XaFbJp45wkAwuWiz8f) to apply a unique **Slug**, **Title**, and **Description** and make it indexable by search engines.

To give you a better ideas of how this can be done, let's do a basic blog setup with [Airtable](/data-sources/1YYStCJukT15Lh2j93qo9A/airtable/jHX7kfH7QvkVcELQvS3VoX) data and take a closer look at each step involved.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Adding content on Airtable">
    We're going to add a new table that has three fields: **Title**, **Body Text**, and **Image**.

    For the Body Text field, we've enabled Rich Text Formatting to be able to add formatting to our content.

    Below, you can see that we've added some formatting to our body text such as bold text, headings, bullet points, etc.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Linking to the table from Softr">
    Now, we need to add a List and List Details blocks in Softr to display the content we just added on Airtable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publishing and testing">
    Finally, let's publish our Softr app and see what we got.
