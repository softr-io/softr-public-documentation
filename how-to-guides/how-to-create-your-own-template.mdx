<Note>Creating templates is available for apps using **Airtable** as a data source.</Note>

## Why would I want to create my own template?

* Speed up the development process as a freelancer/agency.

* Sell templates online as a creator (using services like [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/))

* Use it as a lead generation tool for your business.

* Showcase your no-code skills to build a brand.

## How do I create a template?

**Step 1:** Click on the dropdown menu next to the application name and choose **Create a template**.

* **Template name:** Give it a short and sweet name.

* **Description (50-500 characters):** Share more about what the template is for and how it works.

* **Thumbnail:** Give it a pretty cover

* **Public link to copy your base:** This allows others to copy your template base to be able to use the template properly. Make sure that the link is **read-only** with **copy data** function enabled.

## Where will the template be displayed?

<Tip>**We do not show your templates to other Softr users.**</Tip>

Created templates can be found in your workspace’s **My templates** folder. You can share it with others via a link or submit it to be featured on [Softr Universe](/affiliate-and-referral-programs/wgsQBqYoQV7PZw8qDxYQRC/softr-universe/w9AMPpwoVEczgfhp5XKuVZ).

To access only your templates, click on My Templates on the left toolbar of your Softr Workspace:

## Sharing your template with others

You can share your template, by copying it’s publicly accessible link (a Softr subdomain or your own custom domain) then adding this onto the end of the link:

`/?show-toolbar=true`

The final share link will look something like this for example: `https://portal.yourapp.com/?show-toolbar=true`

A toolbar will appear when using this link that will allow others to copy this template to their own Softr workspaces.
