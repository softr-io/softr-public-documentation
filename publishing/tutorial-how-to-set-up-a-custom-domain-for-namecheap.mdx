<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    First, log in to your [Namecheap account dashboard](https://www.namecheap.com/myaccount/login/).

  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Click into the **“Advanced DNS”** tab. If you see **CNAME Record** and **URL Redirect Record** with parkingpage.namecheap like values please delete them.

    If your screen doesn’t look like the image above, it’s most likely because you have your DNS pointed elsewhere. In other words, to create DNS records at Namecheap, you need to be using **“Namecheap BasicDNS”** which is included with every domain. You can check by going into the **“Domain”** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Click into the **“Advanced DNS”** tab and then click on “**Add New Record”.** If you see an A Record that already exists you will simply need to edit it (skip to the next step).

  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    You will need to create an **A record** (with **@**)and a **CNAME** (with **www**)as well input the **IP address** provided by us (from **Settings => Custom Domain** in Softr Studio), as shown below.
