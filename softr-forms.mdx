Create and publish powerful, conditional forms—without limits, workarounds, or extra tools.

Use Softr Forms to create onboarding and request forms, surveys, event RSVPs, feedback forms, lead capture flows, and more, all in a visual, easy-to-use builder. Form responses are stored automatically in a built-in Softr Database, or send them to external tools, automations, email, or webhooks.

_Note: If you’re building a form _**_inside a Softr app_**_, use the _[**_Conditional_**_ _**_Forms Block_**](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/conditional-forms#conditional-forms)_, which lets you build forms directly into app pages and connect them to app-specific workflows and permissions._

## What you can do with standalone forms

- **Build flexible, conditional forms:** Create multi-step forms with conditional logic, validation rules, custom styling, and personalized endings using a visual builder.
- **Connect form data to your tools:** Store submissions in Softr Databases by default, or route data to external data sources (e.g. Airtable, Notion, Google Sheets, [monday.com](http://monday.com)), automation tools (Zapier, Make), email, or webhooks.
- **Control access and data quality:** Restrict who can submit forms using domain restrictions or email verification, and collect cleaner data with built-in validation and tooltips.
- **Share or embed forms anywhere:** Publish forms via a direct link, use a custom domain, or embed them on any website.
- **Build for free:** Create unlimited forms with unlimited submissions, including on the Free plan. _Note: The _[**_Conditional_**_ \*\*Forms Block_](https://docs.softr.io/building-blocks/conditional-forms#conditional-forms)\* (for Softr apps) is available on the Professional plan and higher.\*

  - You can also access connected data from the **Data** tab at the top of the builder.
- From **Settings \> Options**, you can also set domain restrictions or enable reCaptcha.

  - From **Settings \> Side Section**, you can enable to add a split screen/background image to your form
- From **Steps \> Ending**, set the form ending (confirmation message and next action).

### 5. Set field validation rules and tooltips (optional)

- For each field, open the input settings and scroll to **Validation** to define rules (including custom regex validation).
  - For Email fields, you can use **Validation \> Allow only specific email domains** to restrict submissions.
