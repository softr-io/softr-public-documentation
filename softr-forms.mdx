Softr’s **Standalone Forms** let you create and publish powerful, conditional forms without building a full app first. Use them to collect intake requests, surveys, event RSVPs, or lead capture data, and automatically store responses in Softr Databases or send them to external tools.

## What you can do with standalone forms

- **Create forms without building an app:** Build multi-step forms with conditional logic, custom styling, and personalized endings—perfect when you just need a form, not a full application.
- **Connect form data anywhere:** Store submissions in **Softr Databases** by default, or route data to external data sources (e.g. Airtable, Notion, Google Sheets, [monday.com](http://monday.com)), automation tools (Zapier, Make), email, or webhooks.
- **Control who can submit your forms:** Limit access with **domain restrictions** to ensure only the right users can respond.
- **Publish and embed anywhere:** Share your form with a direct link or embed it on any website—no separate form tool required.

## How to set it up

### 1. Create a new form

### 2. Choose where submission data is sent

- Under **Settings \> Destination** on the right panel, select where form submissions should go:

  - To connect to an external data source (Airtable, Notion, Google Sheets, and more), automation tool (Zapier or Make), Email, or Webhook, click **Integrations** from the dropdown and follow the steps for configuration.
  - You can also access connected data from the **Data** tab at the top of the builder.
- From **Settings \> Options**, you can also set domain restrictions or enable reCaptcha.

### 3. Set domain restrictions (optional)

- From **Settings \> Options**, you can enable domain restrictions, where users must verify their email with a one-time code.
- From here, you can also enable reCaptcha.

### 4. Build your form

  - Field types include: Dropdown, Quick Select, Short text, Long text, Email, Date, Date time, File, Checkbox, URL, Number, Rating, Phone Number, Signature, and Address.
- Use the **Logic** tab to configure conditional logic between steps and fields.
- Customize appearance from the **Styles** tab (note: you can also apply global style settings from the **Theme** section in the left navigation).
  - From **Settings \> Side Section**, you can enable to add a split screen/background image to your form
- From **Steps \> Ending**, set the form ending (confirmation message and next action).

### 5. Set field validation rules and tooltips (optional)

- For each field, open the input settings and scroll to **Validation** to define rules (including custom regex validation).
  - For Email fields, you can use **Validation \> Allow only specific email domains** to restrict submissions.
- From input settings, you can also set a **Tooltip** (under **Label**), along with a **Placeholder**, **Hint**, or **Default** value.

### 6. Publish and share or embed
