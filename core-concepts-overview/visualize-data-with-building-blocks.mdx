**Blocks** are pre-built components that enable you to visualize and interact with data seamlessly. They are the foundation for designing and customizing your app.

Blocks allow you to add different layouts and functionalities, such as a list, table, calendar, or chart. You can configure and arrange these blocks to build the pages within your app and give users a visual way to view and interact with data.

## Block types

An overview of the different types of blocks and how they shape your application:

### Dynamic blocks

Dynamic blocks pull data from data sources (e.g., Airtable, HubSpot, SQL) and display information that updates in real-time based on data changes or user inputs.

**Examples**:

* [List block](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/list-block/pQhPYuA28VXr5tLLFBcbCU): Displays a collection of items, such as products or team members, as a searchable and filterable list.

* [Table block](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/table-block-/j7rGwu7J7zuU69h3bZ7HFe): Displays data in a structured table format with options for users to search, create, and delete records.

* [Calendar block](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/calendar/rdfXqxaPkTFioEbjBBAZai): Displays date-specific items, such as events or appointments, in a calendar format. Users can view, schedule, and edit events.

Dynamic blocks let you display and interact with your data in powerful ways. For each dynamic block you can customize:

* [Data source](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/connect-your-data-source/41p6U2eZs6NZ5qZp7iKvnn): Choose where the block gets its data from, like a spreadsheet or database. You can also decide which users see what data with [conditional filters](/user-groups-and-permissions/3oA6AaFzUiePs2sW2TpYrF/conditional-filters/mDnn7jnpPiYmJcT99jpt7m), sort the information, and set a message to show if there’s no data.

* **Content:** Pick how your data appears, like showing names, dates, or images. The options depend on the type of block you’re using.

* [Actions](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/actions-adding-and-editing-data-/41p6U2eZs87asLz6dV5AMy): Decide what users can do, like clicking to see more details, editing items, or starting a workflow.

* [Style](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/style-your-app/41p6U2eZs8AZmBW8mHykXA)[:](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/style-your-app/41p6U2eZs8AZmBW8mHykXA) Adjust the look of the block—change fonts, colors, spacing, and more to match your style.

* [Visibility](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-groups--permissions/42JZoeYwMqiZYSB8FVGepz#1889a723d691806abe41d80cf622c2e1): Control who can see the block and whether it shows up on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

These options help you make your app more personalized, functional, and visually appealing!

### Static blocks

**Static blocks** display the same content to all users and can be updated manually in Softr. For example, image, text and copy on the block remain consistent until you change it in the softr app.

**Examples**:

* [Hero](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/hero/avyLWEvNZNUqYewF51kMLA): Used as a headline or introductory banner for a page.

* **FAQ**: Displays frequently asked questions and answers.

* [CTA (Call to Action):](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/cta/oPDoXzSUpMuKki92WuBDDH) Encourages users to take specific actions, like signing up or contacting support.

Static blocks help you design the structure and style of your app. For each static block, you can customize:

* **Core elements:** Edit key components like the layout, headings, and subheadings. The available options depend on the block type.

* [Visibility](/core-concepts-overview/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/user-groups--permissions/42JZoeYwMqiZYSB8FVGepz#1889a723d691806abe41d80cf622c2e1): Choose who can see the block and where it appears in your app.

### Container blocks

[Container blocks](/4e750dfd9ab341559f0257df0322ca17?v=971df3d6f8474345b97cbc6fd1f2bb82&pvs=25) group and organize other blocks to provide arrangement and layout options.

**Container block types:**

* [Tabs](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/tabs/38PkeKBDeLtiKuCXp7YeBr): Divide content into tabbed sections that users can switch between. For example, organizing product details, specifications, and reviews in separate tabs.

* [Columns](/building-blocks/vikC2AWEpQGkZd4jGyoVxo/column-container/t7HCEKvV6Y5y2t3hSWwRNx): Displays content side-by-side to create various multi-column layouts. For example, it allows you to place charts side-by-side in a dashboard.

For each Container block, you can customize:

* Layout: Adjust the overall structure, including layout, headings, and subheadings. Options depend on the container type.

* Blocks: Decide which blocks are displayed within the container.

* Visibility: Control who can see the container and its content.

## Add a block

1. Click the **+ icon** in the top-right corner of the canvas. This opens the blocks library in the right-hand panel.
