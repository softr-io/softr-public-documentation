<Tip>This feature is only available to **Professional** and **Business** users.</Tip>

Using this sign-in block, you can allow your users to log in using a random code sent to their email instead of entering a password. Let's quickly review the block settings.

<Tip>The code will be valid **for 5 minutes** after being sent.</Tip>

## **Signin Form**

If the **Only registered users can sign in** toggle is enabled, only the users that already have an account in your Softr app will be able to sign in using this block.

The Domain-based signup option works similar to that of the [Signup Form](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/signup-form/tPe3uxmdcUNeFYuaLTR1o9).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Email">
    Here, you can customize the Email field placeholder text as well as the text on the send button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Code">
    The code field placeholder text and Signin button text can also be customized.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **On Signin**

Finally, you need to choose the page the the users will be taken to after signin.

## Testing

Now, let's see how the block works from the user's standpoint. In the first step, the user needs to enter his/her email address as shown below.

Next, a random code will be send to user's mailbox, which he/she should use in the **Sign in code** 
field to log in. See below.

That's. It only takes a few seconds to get the code and enter the site.
