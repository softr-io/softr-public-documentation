## Logo, Title, and Background Image

You can configure these features in the Features tab in block settings, which is done the same way as on the [Signup Form](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/signup-form/tPe3uxmdcUNeFYuaLTR1o9).

## Signin Form

### **Sign in with Google**

If you enable this option, a **Sign in with Google** button will be added to the form, allowing your users to sign in with their Google Accounts.

<Tip>To enable Google Signup, you first need to add your Google APP Client details in **Integrations => Google Sign In**. You can find instructions on getting the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** [here](/integrations/etS18kJqm1fuD58KCsjC3z/google-sign-in/2hBabh9UqoE8W7aWrfPVFd).</Tip>

If the **Only registered users can sign in** toggle is enabled, only the users that already have an account on your Softr app will be able to sign in with Google.

## Form Fields

### **Email and Password**

Here, you can configure the **Email** and **Password** fields. The placeholder texts of these fields can be modified.

### **Sign In Button**

Lastly, there's the **Sign In** button. The button **Text** can be changed, while the **Action** is predefined and can't be modified.

## Forgot Password

You can enable this option to provide your users with a link to a page where they can reset their password. On that page, you simply need to add a [Forgot Password](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/forgot-password-form/cdXruGUfrkDNtzJi5JWx9s) block, where the users can enter their email and get a link to do a reset.

## Show Signup

You can add an option to go to your [Signup page](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/signup-form/tPe3uxmdcUNeFYuaLTR1o9) for those users who have landed on your Signin page but don't really have an account in your Softr app yet.

## On Signin

Lastly, you should choose which page the users are taken to after signin.

## Block visibility

The block is visible to all visitors of the app, and you have no control over its visibility, hence the default visibility setting is set to "Non-logged in users”.
