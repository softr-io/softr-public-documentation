In the **Theme** section, you can set the default styles and colors for all the building blocks and then customize them for each block separately (from block’s [Styles and Colors settings](/styling/7qXYEkNvWQamR6vcLXzZnF/block-styles-and-formatting/dy4vuKjHgksR4pDJLFKAHP)) if needed.

First comes the **Base Text Size**, which will correspond to the **“m”** size in the individual text field settings. For instance, if you've selected the **Base Text Size** as "16px", the **"m"** **Text Size** in block settings will correspond to 16px, and the other sizes ("s," "l," and so on) will work accordingly.

Next you can set the default **Font Family**, **Font Weight**, and **Color** for your Header (titles) and Body (subtitles and the rest).

Further on, you can set the default **Text Size**, **Text Color**, and **Background Color** for your **buttons**.

Finally, we have the **Advanced** section, where you can set the **Website width**.

You can set the width to **Fixed** (controlled by you), **Full** (to occupy the full width of the screen), or define a **Custom width** (should be at least 1140px).
