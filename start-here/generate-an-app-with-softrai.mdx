**Step 3:** Describe your app idea with a short sentence. Or get inspired by some of our suggestions:

* A client portal for a VC fund to share updates with their investors.

* An employee intranet for knowledge sharing and communicating company updates.

* A directory of companies specializing in VR content and VR experiences.

* A membership platform where businesses keen on franchising can access insights, receive legal advice, and learn from success stories.

* A website for a blockchain consultancy company, presenting successful blockchain integrations, educational workshops, and client success stories.

**Step 4:**  Preview the app to select your preferred theme and accent color.

## What to expect from an AI-generated app?

Depending on the app type, your generated app can include the following:

* Generated data in [Google Sheets](/data-sources/1YYStCJukT15Lh2j93qo9A/google-sheets/jznC9Jr3Jri224AVmHVn4a) (you can connect your own data in Google Sheets or [Airtable](/data-sources/1YYStCJukT15Lh2j93qo9A/airtable/jHX7kfH7QvkVcELQvS3VoX))

* Multiple [Pages and Blocks](/core-concepts/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/pages-and-blocks/jFkbKmHNMLgvriQvosQapg)

* Sample [Users](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/users-tab/5JTzjtbvp8Skemd26A9ho9) and [User Groups](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/overview/6XQfKMeKHUvBcAjKvLs3g3)

* [Action buttons](/actions/ntEfT9zSJk6aY54G6W5KGU/action-buttons-overview/idg8Fqf2kjFwcx6kyP3jNq)

* [Sign-in](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/signin-form/gYwm7wWsqb2bRyJFUreSzN) page

* [User Profiles](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/user-profile/jVikpwBm67W9wozwyDXtjs)

# How to Customize an AI-generated App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your data">
    AI-generated apps already have generated data in Google Sheets connected to the app. You need to copy the database to your Google account to make it your own and customize it as you wish.

    <Info>

    If you want to connect your existing data, you can do that once the template data is copied.

    <Frame caption="Copy generated data">![Copy generated data](/start-here/images/generate-an-app-with-softrai/image4.png)</Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit your app">
    The Studio is your workspace where you design and build your app. In the **left toolbar,** you can access [Pages](/core-concepts/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/pages-and-blocks/jFkbKmHNMLgvriQvosQapg). Create new ones or edit existing pages to your liking.
    <Frame>![Notion image](/start-here/images/generate-an-app-with-softrai/image5.png)</Frame>

    Each page contains [Blocks](/core-concepts/c5VwEbsWtTfPyUZjmEKvfx/pages-and-blocks/jFkbKmHNMLgvriQvosQapg); you can customize the style and function of existing ones or add new blocks.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Users and User groups">
    Generated apps can come with generated user roles. You can update them in the [Users](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/users-tab/5JTzjtbvp8Skemd26A9ho9) setting and customize [User Groups & Permissions](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/users-tab/5JTzjtbvp8Skemd26A9ho9)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Review app settings">
    Before publishing your app, review the app [Settings](/application-settings/n3K2UEfpC9BpHgakMzUU5Y/general-settings/7YdGy1J8X2tjJSv8BGvWQU) to define custom domains, integrations, SEO, and others

  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview & Publish">
    In the upper right corner, you have the **Preview** button, which can be used to preview your app at any moment, and the Publish button when it’s time to go live! Click the **Publish** button on the top right corner. After publishing, you can always make changes in your app and publish your changes the same way.
