All API requests must be authenticated and made over HTTPS.

## Base URL

```
https://tables-api.softr.io/api/v1
```

## Authentication

Pass your Personal Access Token (PAT) in the `Softr-Api-Key` header:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://tables-api.softr.io/api/v1/databases' \
  -H 'Softr-Api-Key: <your-token>'
```

To generate a token, go to [API Setup and Endpoints](/softr-api/api-setup-and-endpoints).

## Token Scoping

- Tokens are scoped to one or more **workspaces**. You can only access databases within your authorized workspaces.
- The token inherits the access rights of the user who created it.
- We currently support Personal Access Tokens only. OAuth access tokens may be supported in the future.
