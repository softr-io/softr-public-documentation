All API calls are subject to rate limiting, enforced per token.

| Operation Type | Limit |
|---|---|
| **Reads** (`GET`, `POST /search`) | 40 requests/second |
| **Writes** (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) | 30 requests/second |

When the limit is exceeded, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code. Back off and retry after a short delay.
