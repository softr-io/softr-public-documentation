In this use case, we are going to use the API to add users to a Softr app via Make. We are going to add users on Airtable and send them to Softr. Let's proceed.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Option 1: Make's Softr module">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setting a Trigger">
        First of all, we're going to create a table on Airtable with **Name**, **Email**, **Password**, **Magic Link, Created Date/Time** (needed for watching record creation in Make) columns to store user data.
        <Frame caption="Table setup on Airtable">![Table setup on Airtable](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image8.png)</Frame>

        Then, we'll go to Make dashboard, create a new scenario, and add a trigger that watches for new records on our selected table. See below.
        <Frame caption="Creating the trigger">![Creating the trigger](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image9.gif)</Frame>

        Now, we need to set up an **Action** to add the users received from Airtable. There are two options for this:

        * **Make's Softr module;**

        * **Custom HTTPrequest.**

        Let's consider each option separately.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configuring the Action">
        Let's add a new module to the scenario, search for "Softr," and select it.
        <Frame caption="Locating the Softr module">![Locating the Softr module](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image3.png)</Frame>

        Then, we are going to choose the **Create a User** option.
        <Frame caption="Choosing the Action">![Choosing the Action](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image4.png)</Frame>

        Next, we need to establish a connection with our Softr account and app, inputing the [Softr API key](/softr-api/tTFQ5vSAUozj5MsKixMH8C/api-setup-and-endpoints/j1PrTZxt7pv3iZCnZ5Fp19) and the domain of the app we want to add users to.
        <Frame caption="Adding a Softr connection">![Adding a Softr connection](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image5.png)</Frame>

        Lastly, we need to map the user fields from our table as shown below.
        <Frame caption="Mapping the user fields">![Mapping the user fields](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image6.png)</Frame>
        <Tip>As you can see, we haven't mapped the **Magiclink** field from the table but have just set the value to **Yes** to generate one automatically. We can sync it back to a [Airtable](/f001252ed01e495d8c0f8e2588f06107) if we [connect it to Softr](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/syncing-users-with-a-data-source/hshRGygHr4T33EnaLntGf9), which we'll discuss in **Step 3**.</Tip>

        That's it. Now, we just need to save the module and the scenario is ready. Let's test it to make sure everything is working correctly.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Testing the Scenario">
        Let's add a new user to our table and check if it's sent to our Softr app successfully.
        <Tip>This is optional, but we are also going to [connect our Softr users base](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/syncing-users-with-a-data-source/hshRGygHr4T33EnaLntGf9) to the same Airtable base and table at the beginning to sync user data **from** **Softr to Airtable** as well. This way, the magic link that's been generated when fetching the user **from Airtable to Softr** will be stored in Softr and eventually **synced back to Airtable**.</Tip>
        <Frame caption="Testing the scenario">![Testing the scenario](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image7.gif)</Frame>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 2: Using a Custom HTTP Request">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Setting a Trigger">
        First of all, we're going to create a table on Airtable with **Name**, **Email**, **Password**, **Magic Link, Created Date/Time** (needed for watching record creation in Make) columns to store user data.
        <Frame caption="Table setup on Airtable">![Table setup on Airtable](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image8.png)</Frame>

        Then, we'll go to Make dashboard, create a new scenario, and add a trigger that watches for new records on our selected table. See below.
        <Frame caption="Creating the trigger">![Creating the trigger](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image9.gif)</Frame>

        Now, we need to set up an **Action** to add the users received from Airtable. There are two options for this:

        * **Make's Softr module;**

        * **Custom HTTPrequest.**

        Let's consider each option separately.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configuring the Action">
        In this case, we need to create a new module, search for **HTTP**, select it, and choose the **Make a request** action.
        <Frame caption="Selecting the action">![Selecting the action](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image10.png)</Frame>

        Now, let's start configuring the module based on our [endpoint](/softr-api/tTFQ5vSAUozj5MsKixMH8C/api-setup-and-endpoints/j1PrTZxt7pv3iZCnZ5Fp19). First we need to add our **URL**, then select the **method** (POST), and finally add the required **headers**. We don't need to add the **Content-Type** header, as it's going to be added in the next step. Below, you can see what it should look like.
        <Frame caption="Configuring URL, Method, and Headers">![Configuring URL, Method, and Headers](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image11.png)</Frame>

        Further on, we need to set the **Body Type** to **Raw** and the **Content Type to JSON**. Lastly, we are going to fill in the **Request Content** using the format provided above. Please, note that the **Parse response** option should be set to **Yes**.
        <Frame caption="Configuring Body and Content types and adding Request content">![Configuring Body and Content types and adding Request content](/softr-api/images/use-case-adding-users-through-make-formerly-integromat/image12.png)</Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Testing the Scenario">
        So, we're almost there. Let's just add a new record in our table and run the scenario to test it. As, you can see below, the user is successfully added to our Softr app.
        <Tip>This is optional, but we are also going to [connect our Softr users base](/add-and-manage-users/pxnkp9H3qyEVMF6XUceqnj/syncing-users-with-a-data-source/hshRGygHr4T33EnaLntGf9) to the same [Airtable](/f001252ed01e495d8c0f8e2588f06107) base and table at the beginning to sync user data **from** **Softr to Airtable** as well. This way, the magiclink that's been generated when fetching the user **from Airtable to Softr** will be stored in Softr and eventually **synced back to Airtable**.</Tip>

## Deleting a User

The [delete request](/softr-api/tTFQ5vSAUozj5MsKixMH8C/api-setup-and-endpoints/j1PrTZxt7pv3iZCnZ5Fp19) can be implemented in a similar way through an HTTP (Make a request) module.
