Iubenda Cookie Solution allows to add a customizable cookie consent banner on your site. You will need an Iubenda subscription for this integration. Let's see how it can be done.

<Tip>By default, Iubenda will block the most common scripts on your site until the user hits **Accept**. More details on privacy controls and cookie solution configuration are available [here](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/1205-how-to-configure-your-cookie-solution-advanced-guide).</Tip>

## Generating a Banner

In your Iubenda account home page, click the **Start Generating** button.

Choose the **Website** option, specify a **Site Name**, and hit **Start Generating**.

Next, if you don't have a paid license, you'll see a pop-up with the upgrade options. You don't need a paid license for the cookie solution, so, if you don't want to upgrade at this point, simply close the pop-up.
