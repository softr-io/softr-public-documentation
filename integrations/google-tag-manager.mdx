The process of integrating Google Tag Manager is pretty straightforward. After creating a container, you just need to locate your **Container ID**. [Here](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696) you can find all the details.

After locating the **Container ID**, you need to copy it and navigate back to your Softr app. Then, you should paste it **Settings => Integration => Google Tag Manager,** and you’re done!

# Alternate Method

<Tip>**NOTE:** Do not combine this method with the standard method above. Doing so will cause your tags to trigger twice and you will receive double the data you should.</Tip>

You can also configure Tag Manager by clicking on the **Settings** icon on the left side of Softr Studio and clicking on **Custom Code.**
