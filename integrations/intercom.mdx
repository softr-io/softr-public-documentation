Intercom is a messaging platform that allows you to communicate with prospective and existing customers. Here, we'll go through the process of adding the Intercom chat widget to your Softr app.

## Locating Intercom Workspace ID

First, you need to locate your Intercom **workspace ID** (app ID). It can be found in the URL of any page you have open in Intercom. It's the code that comes after **apps/**.

The workspace ID can also be found in Settings. In your Intercom account, hover over the account icon in the lower left corner and go to **Settings**.
