## "Send to Zapier" Action

The Zapier integration is available through a **Send to Zapier** action, which can be selected for the [form](/4876cbed455842aebe38e0612d2da96e) submission button.

After selecting the action, a field titled **Zapier** will appear below. Here, you will need to add the **custom webhook URL**, which we’ll discuss shortly.

<Tip>Please, note that if you have a **File** field in your form, the attached file(s) won't be transferred to Zapier. As a workaround, we'd suggest using links (e.g. a Google Drive link) for sending files.</Tip>

## Creating a ZAP

Next, you need to go to your Zapier account and hit the **MAKE A ZAP** button in the upper left corner.

In the app event search bar, look for the **Webhooks by Zapier** app and select it.

Then, select **Catch Hook** as a **Trigger Event** and hit **Continue**.

In the following step, you’ll get a **Custom Webhook URL**, which you need to copy and add it back in the Zapier field of your button action.

## Entering the URL back in Softr Studio

Navigate back to Softr Studio, enter the copied URL as a value in the Zapier field.

Now, you can click to send test data to make sure it's working.

## Checking the Results in Zapier

After sending test data, go back to your Zap setup and proceed to the next step. There you should see a **Test trigger** button.

If after hitting the button your request is found, as shown in the screenshot below, then the integration has been successful, and the only thing left is to click **Continue** to go to the next step in your Zap setup and configure the application to which you want your data to be sent to.

## Sending Data to Google Sheets

In the next step, you need to define the action that the zap needs to accomplish. Let's assume, we want to send the form data to Google Sheets, creating a new row within the sheet for every submission. If for instance, we use the Simple Contact Form, we should have corresponding columns in the sheet to map the fields.

So, in the next **Action** step, we need to choose the Google Sheets app, set **Create Spreadsheet Row** as an **Action Event**, and hit Continue.

In the next step, you need to add your Google account (if it hasn't been added yet) to get access to Google Sheets.
<Frame caption="Connecting Google Sheets account">![Connecting Google Sheets account](/integrations/images/zapier/image15.png)</Frame>

In the next step, you need to add the Google drive where your spreadsheet is located, and select the spreadsheet and worksheet you want to send the data to. Lastly, you need to map the form fields to the corresponding worksheet columns, as shown below.

## Testing the integration

Proceed to the next step, and you're almost done. You just need to test the action to make sure it's working correctly.

If the test was successful, you should see a success message in the next step and your spreadsheet should be updated with the test data, as shown below.

The form is now linked to the spreadsheet and you can start receiving submissions.
